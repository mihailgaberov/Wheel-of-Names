# Wheel of Names

## Build Your Own Wheel of Names

It’s an app, that I presume is inspired by the TV show Wheel of Fortune. In the TV show contestants win prizes for successfully answering question and the Wheel is spun to determine what prize they win.

Wheel of Names is similar, but allows us to create a virtual wheel, putting our own names on it, then virtually spin it to determine a winner. I’ve come across several teams who use it as a fun and informal way to determine which team member will run a ceremony from their process - i.e. their next retrospective.
